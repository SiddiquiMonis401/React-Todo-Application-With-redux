# React-Todo-Application-With-redux
In this project i am trying to use the redux for state handlement.This is the simple todo app in which user could create thier todos
and they could delete todos and made them checked when they have done it this is all i have done in this app.The designs are too bad but 
the main reason behind the project is to learn the redux library.I am running into the issue that onChange event of the check box the state 
changes in the store but the component did not render it again.
